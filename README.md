#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
: Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It is important because it enables the creation of software applications and systems 
that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, 
entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 a) Development of 
programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C). The first commercially available language was FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation), developed in 1956. 
b) Establishment of software engineering as a discipline, which took place in 1968 in Germany. 
c) Advent of structured programming in the 1970s. Structured programming (SP) is a technique devised to improve the reliability and clarity of programs. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements: Gathering and user needs and system requirements.
 - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
 - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
 - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and 
functional requirements.
 - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
 - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Agile and Waterfall are two well-known project management methodologies. 
Both of them are popular in software development but each is best suited for different types of projects. 
The main difference, is that Waterfall is a linear system of working that requires the team to complete each project phase before moving on to the next one while Agile encourages the team to work simultaneously on different phases of the project.
Waterfall is better suited for projects with regulations or requirements because each phaseâ€™s deliverables and strict procedures ensure that they are met. For instance, the Department of Defense and the aerospace industry are a couple of industries that would more likely use Waterfall over Agile, since the requirements are a safety factor. 
Agile is better suited for projects where stakeholders are closely involved every step of the way, and is mostly used in IT companies. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for developing software programs or systems that align with user needs. 
Responsibiliies: 
Design, test and develop the software to meet user needs
Recommend upgrades for existing systems and programs
Develop separate elements of a software that work well in the program as a whole

A quality assurance engineer ensures that the software passes all checks before its release to the public. They oversee every phase of design, development, testing and delivery to verify if the product meets the quality standards and requirements, and they work with a team and report to a manager.

A project manager in software development is a crucial role responsible for overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of software projects. They align project objectives with business goals, manage resources and mitigate risks.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An integrated development environment (IDE) helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application.
Examples of IDEs include NetBeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Visual Studio. 

Version Control Systems are crucial in software development as they efficiently manages and tracks changes to code over time, facilitating team collaboration and project progress tracking.
Bazaar, Mercurial, Git, and Darcs stand out as the most notable examples of VCS softwares.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

- Rapid Advancement of Technology
Strategy: Software engineers should leverage tech trends in software product development to have a cutting edge over competitors.

- Growing Customer Demands
Strategy: Software engineers must work toward understanding underlying business concepts and introduce required features to satisfy the needs of the consumer. 

-Software engineering is time-consuming
Strategy: The engineers should train themselves thoroughly on proper time management so as to avoid late completion of projects. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

 - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Main objective of unit testing is to isolate each component of the software and then perform tests to illustrate that every individual component is accurately meeting the requirements and delivering the expected output.
   
 - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
Main objective of integration testing is to verify whether individual modules, when combined (integrated), work correctly or not as a group.
   
 - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Main objective of this level of testing is to make sure that the software/product meets specified requirements and runs as smoothly as possible in its operating environment. 
  
 - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user 
needs.
Main objective of acceptance testing is to evaluate whether the software complies with the end-user requirements and whether it is ready for deployment. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of structuring an instruction that can be interpreted and understood by a generative AI model.

- It ensures that AI models produce accurate and relevant outputs. It's the art of crafting effective prompts that guide the model's behavior, ensuring effective human-AI communication.
- Furthermore, prompt engineering plays a role in software development by using AI models to generate code snippets or provide solutions to programming challenges. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: How much do Kenyans earn? 
Improved prompt: What is the per capita income of Kenya? 

The improved version is more effective because it uses a standard and globally accepted method or approach to estimate the income of an average person in Kenya. The first prompt is ambiguous in that it does not specify the exact category of the population whose remuneration is of interest.
